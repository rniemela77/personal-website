        <h2>Knowing Less, Growing More</h2>
        <i class="subtitle">How to grow without falling apart.</i>

        <h3>Knowns and Unknowns</h3>
        <p>Knowledge has four corners:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First: You know something, and you know you know it. <blockquote class="text-muted">Example: Tying your
                    shoes. You say, "Let me show you
                    how."</blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>Second: You know you don't know something. <blockquote class="text-muted">Example: You've heard of the
                    "Turtle Knot", but couldn't tie it if
                    your life depended on it. "I know about it but I don't know how."</blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>Third: You don't know that you know something. <blockquote class="text-muted">Example: You keep a tidy
                    desk because it feels right, but
                    really, your brain is wired to prefer clear sightlines for safety. "It seems right."</blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>Fourth: You don't know that you don't know something. <blockquote class="text-muted">Example: You've
                    been using a word wrong your whole life until someone corrects you. "I had no idea!"
                </blockquote>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Assuming you don't know everything helps. When we're sure we know something, we ignore evidence that doesn't
            fit. If we assume successful people wake up at 5AM, and we meet a successful person who sleeps in, we're
            likely to make an exception for them instead of questioning our assumption. "Oh, he's just an exception."
        </p>

        <h3>Balancing Open Mindness</h3>
        <p>You can't take in everything. Filtering some information is necessary, just to function. But too much
            filtering, and your beliefs turn to stone, like a bridge that can't bend.</p>
        <p>No beliefs, and you're paralyzed, unable to act or predict. Too rigid, and you're blind to change. It's like
            driving with an old map, insisting that the roads haven't shifted.</p>
        <p>Your beliefs should guide you, not trap you.</p>

        <h3>Curiosity and Conviction</h3>
        <p>Conviction can make you strong, but too much and you are brittle, like an oak in a storm- you'll break.</p>
        <p>A palm tree bends and stays standing. A fighter who stays rigid gets hit. They need to move and adapt.</p>
        <p>No perfect defense- no perfect belief.</p>
        <p>In buddhism, they say a stone Buddha wont cross a river. Pin it down, and you lose it.</p>
        <p>Better to stay loose, like a beginner, always open.</p>
        <p>Someone said you never know the whole thing, you just learn and become less wrong.</p>
        <p>Instead of saying "I know", say "I've observed" or "My intuition tells me". Leave room for the unknown.</p>

        <h3>Flexibility and Strength</h3>
        <p>Loosening your grip on beliefs feels dangerous, like you'll lose yourself or get fooled.</p>
        <p>But, often those beliefs protect us from pain we don't want to face. Like believing you cant trust anyone
            after being hurt.</p>
        <p>It shields you, but it also isolates you.</p>
        <p>Growth means letting go of that shield, not all at once, but gradually. Like acknowledging the pain, but
            choosing to trust again anyway.</p>
        <p>It's scary, it means giving up who you thought you were, but that's how you get stronger.</p>
